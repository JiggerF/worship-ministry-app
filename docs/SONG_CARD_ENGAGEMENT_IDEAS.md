# Song Card Engagement Ideas

## 1. Instant Access to What Matters
- **One-click open for chord charts**: Musicians love speed.
- **Quick listen**: Add a 10s audio preview or embedded YouTube player (not just a link).
- **Setlist integration**: Show if/when this song is scheduled next.

## 2. Personalization & Smart Features
- **Favorite/Star**: Let musicians “star” songs for quick access.
- **Recently viewed**: Show a “Recently viewed” or “Your favorites” section at the top.
- **Practice mode**: Add a “Practice” button that opens a focused view with chart, audio, and metronome.

## 3. Social & Feedback
- **Comments/Notes**: Allow musicians to leave tips or notes (e.g., “Watch the bridge timing!”).
- **Song rating**: Let users rate the arrangement or difficulty.
- **“Who’s played this?”**: Show avatars of team members who’ve played this song recently.

## 4. Smart Actions
- **Download all**: One-click to download all charts for the set.
- **Transpose & print**: “Print in my key” button for instant, personalized printouts.
- **Auto-scroll**: Add an auto-scroll feature for charts on mobile.

## 5. Visual Cues & Gamification
- **Badges**: “New”, “Popular”, “Most played”, “Recently updated”.
- **Progress tracking**: “You’ve played this 3 times” or “Last played: Jan 2026”.

## 6. Seamless Mobile Experience
- **Mobile-first design**: Ensure all actions are thumb-friendly and fast.
- **Offline access**: Allow saving charts for offline use.

## 7. Notifications & Reminders
- **Practice reminders**: “You’re scheduled to play this Sunday—review this song?”
- **New chart alert**: Notify when a new chart or key is uploaded.
